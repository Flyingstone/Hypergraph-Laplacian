# Hypergraph-Laplacian
Demonstration for AAAI-18 paper Saito, S, Mandic, D.P., and Suzuki, H. 2018 Hypergraph p-Laplacian: A Differential Geometry View.
This program demonstrate unspervised clustering in the paper, Saito, S, Mandic, D.P., and Suzuki, H. 2018 Hypergraph p-Laplacian: A Differential Geometry View. In Proc. AAAI to appear.
Here we compare with exsitent Laplacian, proposed by
